the references to sarakenisti and grikisti in here are v interesting
fn 90 in the Arabic is generally correct, I think-- Constantine is kind of doing his own thing in this chapter. but there's some stuff in the Gk (or at least Vat gr 300) that doesn't line up with the extant Ar text; the aphanistika trichon section on f. 17r does not appear to be in the Arabic, for ex. (and isn't in BnF grec 2311, either; cf. f. 8r)
-> but why did both Constantine _and_ Phillip Xeros feel the need to freelance in this particular chapter? surely the subject matter helped, but was there some textual thing in their source MSS that prompted them to make their changes?
** TRANSCRIPTION_DONE I.v - f. 17v
** TRANSCRIPTION_DONE I.vi - f. 18v
τὰ φύλλα τῆς μυρίκης . ὅ λέγεται τάρφε is interesting
** TRANSCRIPTION_DONE I.vii - f. 19v
ends with εἰ θεῶ φίλον, interestingly, like the Arabic text
** TRANSCRIPTION_DONE I.viii - f. 20r
the frequent references to sarakhnisti are interesting here; comparing Constantine's use of memithe might be interesting
** TRANSCRIPTION_DONE I.ix - f. 21r 
λεγεται δε αρραβιστι !
** TRANSCRIPTION_DONE I.x

done; towards end of this chapter, accents became less consistent, there were more (presumably pharmacological) symbols and abbreviations. I have captured some of these variations but not all of them, and perhaps not totally consistently
